== Little Gidding

This is the source code for a web site that can be found at http://littlegidding.pauldyck.com/

The purpose of the web site is to present an XML version of a Gospel harmony in an interesting way,
and facilitate work on the identification of the images used in the harmony.

The source code that I've written is under the MIT licence. However, the various frameworks and
plugins used here have their own licence terms, so you'll need to pay attention to that as well.
