<!-- We have been using [ ] for information missing from figures, but it can mean two different things: info, such as engraver, that wasn't originally on the plate, and info that has been cropped by LG.  This needs disambiguation. -->
<!-- To handle composite images, I have placed multiple source tags within a single figure tag, each followed by other tags normal to figures.  I have begun each source text with a number. -->
<!-- Gospelgrab 14 comes after Ryan's interface and adds information from Plantin-Moretus and Hollstein to some figures.-->
<!--Gospelgrab.9x was succeeded by 10, 11, 12?, and 13-.  Thus, gospelgrab.13- is the most recent document, though for some reason it is a bit smaller file than the earlier ones.  We will rename the file from "gospelgrab" soon.-->
<!-- In gospelgrab.87 we have changed image tags to figure tags, and changed the attribute description to figdesc. -->

    <!-- In gospelgrab9c. xml, we corrected the gospel text to the original, adding all textual markings including double hyphens (use equal sign =), asterisks, double bars (use two bars ||), paraphs (open character map and use ❡ ) and crosses (character map and use ✝) and &#x17F; for long s.  Note: we have a conflict with the * sign in that we've used it two ways: rightly to signify a * in the original, and (to be changed, also to note a superscripted contraction.  This latter only occurs in the handwritten parts of the text, those these are not always in the same tags.  Q: how should we tag superscript?  This should be a typographic tag, "hi rend"-->
    <!-- use TODO for things to do -->
    <!-- each image should have a figure tag -->
    <!-- for each image, I would also like to add a coordinates tag that indicates its position on a master image.  From this information, I would like to generate an approximate actual size to go in the size tag.  A user should be able to work either way: from the transcription pulling up either an entire page image or an image of a particular part of the page, or, from the page image, pulling up the transcription and encoded information.  Question: should we have a coordinates tag for every excerpt as well, so that one could at any time pull up the image of the excerpt, or is the page image sufficient?  We could, alternatively, have a column image, which would give the text plus its context without giving the whole opening. -->
    <!-- we need some way to identify the handful of times when the context or comparison is pasted over an image -->
    <!-- There are four creator roles given on the plates themselves: inven, for inventor, or the person who painted or otherwise made the initial image; sculp, for sculptor?, for the engraver; ex, for excudebat, for the printer; and fe, for fecit, for the maker. Fe seems to be used only together with inven, so it may mean one or both of sculp and ex. -->

      <!-- For this page, I have marked all the text in the comment tag as either roman or italic.  After this page, I am marking only the roman, thinking that we can make italic the default for comment tags.  Backing up a step, I have created the look tag to refer to the appearance of comments, and given it letter and color attributes. --><!-- I am using comment tags for all the handwriting in the book except for that which occurs on images.  The latter I've tagged with a MS attribute within the image tag.  The Image tag also has a text attribute, which is for text that is part of the original image, as opposed to text that has been added by hand at Little Gidding.  Regarding columns, we have made the col attribute available within both hchapter and image tags, so that we can set a marker for the beginning of the chapter and also for the placement of images within that chapter.  We are not, however, repeating col numbers, so images without a col specified are found on the col indicated in the hchapter tag. -->

      <head>De Leproso et Centurione. Matth.5.</head>
      <text>1. Descendenti Dño de monte occurit Leprosus supplicans, Dñe si vis, potes me mundare;
        cui Dominus extensâ manu, Volo. Mundare. 2. Centurio Chriſtum rogat pro famulo magna fide et
        humilitate, profitens. Domine non sum dignus, &amp;c. 3. Admiratus Dominus fidem
        Centurionis, curat eius puerum, et de Gentilium conuersione praedicit.</text>
